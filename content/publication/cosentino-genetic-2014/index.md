abstract: In Trypanosoma cruzi the isoprenoid and sterol biosynthesis pathways are
  validated targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. In this work we present a study
  of the genetic diversity observed in genes from these pathways. Using a number of
  bioinformatic strategies, we first identified genes that were missing and/or were
  truncated in the T. cruzi genome. Based on this analysis we obtained the complete
  sequence of the ortholog of the yeast ERG26 gene and identified a non-orthologous
  homolog of the yeast ERG25 gene (sterol methyl oxidase, SMO), and we propose that
  the orthologs of ERG25 have been lost in trypanosomes (but not in Leishmanias).
  Next, starting from a set of 16 T. cruzi strains representative of all extant evolutionary
  lineages, we amplified and sequenced ∼ 24 Kbp from 22 genes, identifying a total
  of 975 SNPs or fixed differences, of which 28% represent non-synonymous changes.
  We observed genes with a density of substitutions ranging from those close to the
  average (∼ 2.5/100 bp) to some showing a high number of changes (11.4/100 bp, for
  the putative lathosterol oxidase gene). All the genes of the pathway are under apparent
  purifying selection, but genes coding for the sterol C14-demethylase, the HMG-CoA
  synthase, and the HMG-CoA reductase have the lowest density of missense SNPs in
  the panel. Other genes (TcPMK, TcSMO-like) have a relatively high density of non-synonymous
  SNPs (2.5 and 1.9 every 100 bp, respectively). However, none of the non-synonymous
  changes identified affect a catalytic or ligand binding site residue. A comparative
  analysis of the corresponding genes from African trypanosomes and Leishmania shows
  similar levels of apparent selection for each gene. This information will be essential
  for future drug development studies focused on this pathway.
