abstract: "BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' Disease.\
  \ The parasite has a complex population structure, with six major evolutionary lineages,\
  \ some of which have apparently resulted from ancestral hybridization events. Because\
  \ there are important biological differences between these lineages, strain typing\
  \ methods are essential to study the T. cruzi species. Currently, there are a number\
  \ of typing methods available for T. cruzi, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\
  \ However, most of these methods are based on the amplification of a variable number\
  \ of loci. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present a simple typing assay for\
  \ T. cruzi, based on the amplification of a single polymorphic locus: the TcSC5D\
  \ gene. When analyzing sequences from this gene (a putative lathosterol/episterol\
  \ oxidase) we observed a number of interesting polymorphic sites, including 1 tetra-allelic,\
  \ and a number of informative tri- and bi-allelic SNPs. Furthermore, some of these\
  \ SNPs were located within the recognition sequences of two commercially available\
  \ restriction enzymes. A double digestion with these enzymes generates a unique\
  \ restriction pattern that allows a simple classification of strains in six major\
  \ groups, corresponding to DTUs TcI-TcIV, the recently proposed Tcbat lineage, and\
  \ TcV/TcVI (as a group). Direct sequencing of the amplicon allows the classification\
  \ of strains into seven groups, including the six currently recognized evolutionary\
  \ lineages, by analyzing only a few discriminant polymorphic sites. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:\
  \ Based on these findings we propose a simple typing assay for T. cruzi that requires\
  \ a single PCR amplification followed either by restriction fragment length polymorphism\
  \ analysis, or direct sequencing. In the panel of strains tested, the sequencing-based\
  \ method displays equivalent inter-lineage resolution to recent multi- locus sequence\
  \ typing assays. Due to their simplicity and low cost, the proposed assays represent\
  \ a good alternative to rapidly screen strain collections, providing the cornerstone\
  \ for the development of robust typing strategies."
