 abstract = {Ribosomes are the machinery responsible for reading mRNAs and translating them into proteins. The ribosome profiling approach is based on high-throughput sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNAs. RNAs not harboring ribosomes are removed by nuclease digestion leaving the so-called ribosome "footprints." The purified "footprint" RNA molecules are processed into DNA libraries and their individual abundance is determined by deep sequencing. Ribosome profiling reveals the portion of transcripts which are actually protein-coding and can be used for differential gene expression analysis addressing rates of protein synthesis, and translational control and efficiency.},
