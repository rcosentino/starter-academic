I am PostDoc in the laboratory of Experimental Parasitology, in the Department of Veterinary Sciences from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. In the last years i have been working in generating allele-specific genome assemblies of Trypanosome parasites, combining PacBio long-read sequencing data and chromosome conformation capture data. I am interested in sequencing data analysis towards functional genomics implementing reproducible pipelines.
