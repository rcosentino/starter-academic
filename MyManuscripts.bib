Yet, to date most reference genome assemblies represent a mosaic consensus sequence in which the homologous chromosomes have been collapsed into one sequence. This procedure generates sequence artefacts and impedes analyses of allele-specific mechanisms. Here, we report the allele-specific genome assembly of the diploid unicellular protozoan parasite \textit{Trypanosoma brucei}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}As a first step, we called variants on the allele-collapsed assembly of the \textit{T. brucei} Lister 427 isolate using short-read error-corrected PacBio reads. We identified 96 thousand heterozygote variants across the genome (average of 4.2 variants / kb), and observed that the variant density along the chromosomes was highly uneven. Several long (\&gt;100 kb) regions of loss-of-heterozigosity (LOH) were identified, suggesting recent recombination events between the alleles. By analysing available genomic sequencing data of multiple Lister 427 derived clones, we found that most LOH regions were conserved, except for some that were specific to clones adapted to the insect lifecycle stage. Surprisingly, we also found that some Lister 427 clones were aneuploid. We found evidence of trisomy in chromosome five (chr 5), chr 2, chr 6 and chr 7. Moreover, by analysing RNA-seq data, we showed that the transcript level is proportional to the ploidy, evidencing the lack of a general expression control at the transcript level in \textit{T. brucei}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}As a second step, to generate an allele-specific genome assembly, we used two powerful datatypes for haplotype reconstruction: raw long reads (PacBio) and chromosome conformation (Hi-C) data. With this approach, we were able to assign 99.5\% of all heterozygote variants to a specific homologous chromosome, building a 66 Mb long \textit{T. brucei} Lister 427 allele-specific genome assembly. Hereby, we identified genes with allele-specific premature termination codons and showed that differences in allele-specific expression at the level of transcription and translation can be accurately monitored with the fully phased genome assembly.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The obtained reference-grade allele-specific genome assembly of \textit{T. brucei} will enable the analysis of allele-specific phenomena, as well as the better understanding of recombination and evolutionary processes.

	abstract = {Despite their importance for most DNA-templated processes, the function of individual histone modifications has remained largely unknown because in vivo mutational analyses are lacking. The reason for this is that histone genes are encoded by multigene families and that tools to simultaneously edit multiple genomic loci with high efficiency are only now becoming available. To overcome these challenges, we have taken advantage of the power of CRISPR-Cas9 for precise genome editing and of the fact that most DNA repair in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei occurs via homologous recombination. By establishing an episome-based CRISPR-Cas9 system for T. brucei, we have edited wild type cells without inserting selectable markers, inserted a GFP tag between an ORF and its 3'UTR, deleted both alleles of a gene in a single transfection, and performed precise editing of genes that exist in multicopy arrays, replacing histone H4K4 with H4R4 in the absence of detectable off-target effects. The newly established genome editing toolbox allows for the generation of precise mutants without needing to change other regions of the genome, opening up opportunities to study the role of individual histone modifications, catalytic sites of enzymes or the regulatory potential of UTRs in their endogenous environments.},

	abstract = {In Trypanosoma cruzi the isoprenoid and sterol biosynthesis pathways are validated targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. In this work we present a study of the genetic diversity observed in genes from these pathways. Using a number of bioinformatic strategies, we first identified genes that were missing and/or were truncated in the T. cruzi genome. Based on this analysis we obtained the complete sequence of the ortholog of the yeast ERG26 gene and identified a non-orthologous homolog of the yeast ERG25 gene (sterol methyl oxidase, SMO), and we propose that the orthologs of ERG25 have been lost in trypanosomes (but not in Leishmanias). Next, starting from a set of 16 T. cruzi strains representative of all extant evolutionary lineages, we amplified and sequenced ∼ 24 Kbp from 22 genes, identifying a total of 975 SNPs or fixed differences, of which 28\% represent non-synonymous changes. We observed genes with a density of substitutions ranging from those close to the average (∼ 2.5/100 bp) to some showing a high number of changes (11.4/100 bp, for the putative lathosterol oxidase gene). All the genes of the pathway are under apparent purifying selection, but genes coding for the sterol C14-demethylase, the HMG-CoA synthase, and the HMG-CoA reductase have the lowest density of missense SNPs in the panel. Other genes (TcPMK, TcSMO-like) have a relatively high density of non-synonymous SNPs (2.5 and 1.9 every 100 bp, respectively). However, none of the non-synonymous changes identified affect a catalytic or ligand binding site residue. A comparative analysis of the corresponding genes from African trypanosomes and Leishmania shows similar levels of apparent selection for each gene. This information will be essential for future drug development studies focused on this pathway.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' Disease. The parasite has a complex population structure, with six major evolutionary lineages, some of which have apparently resulted from ancestral hybridization events. Because there are important biological differences between these lineages, strain typing methods are essential to study the T. cruzi species. Currently, there are a number of typing methods available for T. cruzi, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. However, most of these methods are based on the amplification of a variable number of loci.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present a simple typing assay for T. cruzi, based on the amplification of a single polymorphic locus: the TcSC5D gene. When analyzing sequences from this gene (a putative lathosterol/episterol oxidase) we observed a number of interesting polymorphic sites, including 1 tetra-allelic, and a number of informative tri- and bi-allelic SNPs. Furthermore, some of these SNPs were located within the recognition sequences of two commercially available restriction enzymes. A double digestion with these enzymes generates a unique restriction pattern that allows a simple classification of strains in six major groups, corresponding to DTUs TcI-TcIV, the recently proposed Tcbat lineage, and TcV/TcVI (as a group). Direct sequencing of the amplicon allows the classification of strains into seven groups, including the six currently recognized evolutionary lineages, by analyzing only a few discriminant polymorphic sites.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings we propose a simple typing assay for T. cruzi that requires a single PCR amplification followed either by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, or direct sequencing. In the panel of strains tested, the sequencing-based method displays equivalent inter-lineage resolution to recent multi- locus sequence typing assays. Due to their simplicity and low cost, the proposed assays represent a good alternative to rapidly screen strain collections, providing the cornerstone for the development of robust typing strategies.},
