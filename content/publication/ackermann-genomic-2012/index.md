abstract: Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas Disease, affects more than
  16 million people in Latin America. The clinical outcome of the disease results
  from a complex interplay between environmental factors and the genetic background
  of both the human host and the parasite. However, knowledge of the genetic diversity
  of the parasite, is currently limited to a number of highly studied loci. The availability
  of a number of genomes from different evolutionary lineages of T. cruzi provides
  an unprecedented opportunity to look at the genetic diversity of the parasite at
  a genomic scale.
