abstract: Ribosomes are the machinery responsible for reading mRNAs and translating
  them into proteins. The ribosome profiling approach is based on high-throughput
  sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNAs. RNAs not harboring ribosomes are removed
  by nuclease digestion leaving the so-called ribosome \"footprints.\" The purified
  \"footprint\" RNA molecules are processed into DNA libraries and their individual
  abundance is determined by deep sequencing. Ribosome profiling reveals the portion
  of transcripts which are actually protein-coding and can be used for differential
  gene expression analysis addressing rates of protein synthesis, and translational
  control and efficiency.
